The problem : Important reminders/notifications tend to get missed out. The reason being, the important ones arrive in the midst of a barrage of 
lesser important notifications( from apps like inshorts to Gmail) and the only thing we'd like to do is clear all of them.

There are ways to circumvent this problem by switching off notifications for certain apps. This, however, is still not efficient, as we 
will still receive notifications from at least a few of the plethora of apps installed which can result in the truly important ones being missed.



WhatsApp : Unlike the other social media platforms, WhatsApp is unique. While 'no ads' is one way it stands apart, another more subtle way
is that, it's more important. With over 1.5 billions users, WhatsApp is the platform where the relatively formal groups, be it in school, or Univ , or 
at the workplace, are formed. Thus, while netizens can shy away from Instagram or Facebook or Snapchat without worries, they can't from WhatsApp. 
They worry that they might miss something useful and hence keep a constant watch for new messages.


The solution : A WhatsApp Bot which sends reminders that users and businesses set.

Users and Businesses must be able to set up reminders by messaging the Bot. The Bot will then remind/notify the user about the activity to be 
completed at that particular time by messaging the user back.

Messages from the Whatsapp Bot must be pinned to the top of the User's message list so that the reminders will be immediately caught by the eye.


The advantages over current systems (Including Google’s Bot) : 


1. Users will always keep checking WhatsApp and will not miss the reminders.

2.  The important reminders are present in one location and any new reminder will quickly grab the user’s eye.

3. It is very easy to set up a new important reminder.


The Benefits for WhatsApp : 


1. Huge value generating feature for WhatsApp Business.

2. A feature which stands out compared to competitors for WhatsApp users.

3. Both the above two points achieved feasibly at a relatively very low cost.
